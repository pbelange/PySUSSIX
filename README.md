# PySUSSIX

A Python implementation for the frequency analysis tool `SUSSIX`, cf. https://cds.cern.ch/record/702438/ .


see PySussix/ducksussix for isolated version of the subroutines
see PySussix/f90sussix/docstrings.ipynb for the docstrings of all the subroutines of sussix


Work in progress... will need to rewrite the duckroutines to be fully independant of fortran, this is testing phase.
